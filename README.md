# paye-calculator
A Python class which calculates PAYE, National Insurance (N.I.), Employer's N.I. and Student Loan Repayment Deductions for the U.K. tax system for 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019.
 
# Installation
 
You can download the class by either..

(a) Clicking the 'Clone or download' button above, top right at https://github.com/clicktechnology/pyPAYE.git and downloading the package to a directory of your choice.

or

(b) In Linux, open a terminal window with Ctrl + Alt + T or click the start button and in the search dialog type 'terminal' or 'xterm'.  Click on the Terminal Emulator to start the terminal emulator.

Once opened, the terminal shows your prompt, similar to the one below.
```

```

We use, unsurprisingly, software called 'git' to manage and control our software versioning so let's make sure it is installed.  Install it with the following command on Debian / Ubuntu Linux.

```
sudo apt-get install -y git
```

..entering your logon password to start the installation, if required.  Once installed, now type..

```
git clone https://github.com/clicktechnology/pyPAYE.git
```

and press return.  The paye module is downloaded to a subdirectory called paye-calculator.  Go straight there by typing..

```
cd pyPAYE
```

Now the class has been downloaded, you can install it by typing

```
python setup.py install
```

or, if you prefer to just see it in action, type..

```
./test.py
```


# Usage

Create a file called mytax.py using an editor of your choice.

Add in the following lines at the top of the file so the file can run from the command line.

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding=utf-8
```

Next, we need to import the taxation class by adding this line next.

```
from taxation import Taxation
``` 

Now let's create a Taxation object from the Taxation class with the command

```
myEmployee = Taxation(full_time=True, student_loan=True, hours_per_week=40, tax_year='2018-2019')
```

OK, let's print the PAYE payable in 2018-2019 for say, £50,000 salary, where the = indicates there is no student loan repayment.

```
myEmployee.print_tax_ticket(50000,0)
```

The complete file should look like this..

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# coding=utf-8
        
from taxation import Taxation
        
myEmployee = Taxation(full_time=True, student_loan=True, hours_per_week=40, tax_year='2018-2019')
myEmployee.print_tax_ticket(50000,0)

```

Now save and exit.  In the command line where the file is saved, type.. 

```
python ./mytax.py
```
    
The result shown is..

```

In the root of the package, the file called test.py contains additional calculations and examples of the calculation of Employer's NI, Employee's NI and Student Loan Repayments for both Plan 1 and Plan 2 repayment options.
